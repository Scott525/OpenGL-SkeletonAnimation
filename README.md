# OpenGL Project

### Introduction

This is my Computer Graphic personal project.

This project based on my self-study on the website: https://learnopengl.com/, which contains a series of exercise and a final project. In the final project, I want to recreate the scene and few main characters of GenShin Imapct.

The idea of this project is inspired by those famous GenShin MMD, so i really want to make those characters dance at certain stage. So most of the models in this project are converted from .pmx to .fbx or .obj. To modify models, I learned the basic usage of Blender and other popular mmd tools.

Wish you like it.
